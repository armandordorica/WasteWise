# WasteWise

WasteWise is an AI powered model that takes as input an image and outputs where the item must be disposed based on the policy of the city of Toronto ([What Goes in the Blue Bin (Recycling)?](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/houses/what-goes-in-my-blue-bin/)). 

### Data Source 

The recycling policy for the City of Toronto was obtained using [this link](https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/hr/dataset/waste-wizard-lookup-table).
